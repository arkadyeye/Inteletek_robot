ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Intelitek ER-4U CLI Project!
This project provides a CLI example of accesing Intelitek ER-4U Robot C++ API.

What is this?
This is a minimal Command Line Interface (CLI) written to serve one primary purpose: to be a clear, commented, and executable example of how to initialize, control, and monitor the ER-4U using the raw DLL functions in a 2024-compatible Windows environment (x86).

Why use this?
Learning: Easily see the exact API calls needed for any robot action (e.g., initialization, homing, I/O).

Experimentation: Safely test callback functions, motion limits, and torque streaming.

Foundation: Use this clean C++ code as a blueprint for your own higher-level projects (e.g., network control, custom GUI).

Getting Started
All the detailed steps, from installing the prerequisite SCORBASE software to setting up the necessary configuration files and compiling the code using the x86 Developer Command Prompt, are documented in the Er4U_cli PDF file.

We recommend you start by confirming your robot works perfectly with the original ScorBase application,GET FAMILAR WITH IT, 
then follow the documentation to set up the Required Files ,compile ,and explore the internal API functionality.

We hope this tool helps you master the ER-4U robot!
